# Digital-Toothbrush-Timer
This project is to create an electronic toothbrush timer using two 8x8 LED matrices (MAX7219), an Arduino nano, and a MPU9250 gyroscopic sensor.  This will all be contained in a  custom made 3d printed housing shaped like an hourglass. The timer should start when flipped over and continue dropping sand for 2 minutes.
